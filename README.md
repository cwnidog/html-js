=======

Combines html and js into a web page displaying the LEGENDARY TORTIOSE & HARE RACE.
The main goal is to update the position of the tortoise & hare elements during the race

We also decided to allow the user to select participants.

Animal images are copyright Zynga (from Farmville).
Coding help from w3schools & stack overflow (especially loop delay in JS).
